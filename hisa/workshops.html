        <h2>Support in Mind, A Community Approach to Mental Health</h2>

        <h3>Monday 25th January, 12.30 - 13.15</h3>

        <p>We hear a lot about mental health these days! What’s going on with it? Why does it matter? We hear that
            ‘Mental Health is Everyone’s Business’ – if that is the case then what can we all do about it? Join Ros
            Halley of the mental health charity Support in Mind Scotland for a workshop on developing A Community
            Approach to Mental Health.</p>

        <p>Ros has many years’ experience of working in community development in Scotland’s regions. Since 2017, she has
            been working with the mental health charity and the National Rural Mental Health Forum to develop a new
            approach to supporting mental health. This ground-breaking work shows clear indications that this new way of
            thinking about tackling mental ill-health can galvanise people across the country to take collective action
            on the ground.</p>

        <p>In this 45 min workshop, Ros will talk about what a Community-Led Mental Health approach means, why it could
            transform the way that we deliver mental health support and how we all can contribute to improving societal
            wellbeing. Ros will share her experience of community-based research in Scotland’s rural regions and
            highlight the challenges that exist and what could be done to help turn things around. </p>

        <p>The workshop will be an opportunity to explore how everyone can build their own knowledge and adapt their own
            actions to make Scotland a better place for mental health.</p>

        <h3>Monday 25th January, 12.30 - 13.15</h3>

        <p>Technological and societal disruptions are coming at us thick and fast. Whilst we cannot predict the future,
            we can prepare for a future that is increasingly unpredictable.</p>

        <p>Scotland’s citizens need the skills not only to cope with the change but to thrive in it, as well as to take

            skills that will be required for this. This future focussed work is driving innovation in our products and
            services to make sure Scotland’s citizens and employers are prepared for this complex future.</p>

        <p>This thought-provoking interactive workshop intends to stop and make you think how prepared are you for the
            future of work and what skills do you have that will support your lifelong career journey.</p>

        <p>We will discuss:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Industry 4.0 &amp; Scotland 2035</li>
            <li>Meta Skills and their role in ensuring Scotland’s people and economy thrive</li>
