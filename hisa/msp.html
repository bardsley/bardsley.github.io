                <h2><span class="party">Scottish Green Party</span> Ariane Burgess</h2>

                <p>Ariane Burgess is the Scottish Green Party’s lead candidate for the Highlands and Islands region.
                        Ariane chose to make the Highlands her home when she returned to Scotland after living in the US
                        for twenty years. She is dedicated to finding constructive ways in which we can respond to the
                        two most urgent emergencies we’re facing today: climate and nature. She’s also well aware of the
                        regional emergencies we’re facing: depopulation and the challenges to our mental health –
                        heightened by the rapid changes to the ways we live and loss of work as a result of the COVID-19
                        pandemic.</p>

                <p>She’s been involved in a wide range of sustainability projects from starting community gardens and
                        orchards, project managing one of the region’s first cohousing projects, to teaching people
                        sustainable village design. During the first lockdown she coordinated the grassroots outpouring
                        in her community that saw neighbours assisting neighbours to get food and medicines.</p>

                <p>Through her work she’s seen first-hand the incredible success communities have with locally-owned
                        renewable energy, community investment, car share schemes and other community-led initiatives as
                        well as the genuine impulse people have to work together for the common good.</p>

                <p>It is her hope that her experiences of turning creative thinking and sustainable design into tangible
                        benefits for communities can be an asset at Holyrood.</p>
