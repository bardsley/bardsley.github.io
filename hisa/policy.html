    <h2>International Student Support over Brexit</h2>

    <div class="details">
        <div class="core">
            <div class="change">
                <h3>What needs to change</h3>

                <p>At the moment, international student support within UHI is weak and sporadic, especially in view of
                    Brexit. Within UHI, contacting international student support staff, whether this is regional or
                    local,
                    creates significant challenges, and as a consequence of this, clear, coherent information is
                    difficult
                    to access.</p>

                <p>International students are sometimes entrusted to their PATs, but this does not always satisfy the
                    necessity for further support or information. At times it seems that international students are left
                    to
                    themselves, lacking a solid underlying support system.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="do">
                <h3>What can HISA do about it</h3>

                <p>HISA can campaign to increase international student support awareness on a regional and national
                    level,
                    working in partnership with other SAs. HISA can lobby UHI to establish specific international
                    support
                    staff in each AP, easy to contact wherever in need.</p>

                <p>HISA can campaign for the increase of international student support, facilitating the flow of
                    information
                    about entry requirements, immigration scheme, student loans, and much more.</p>

                <p>HISA can invest in the creation of an international student package, containing useful information,
                    signposting websites and staff.</p>
            </div>

        </div>
        <div class="facts">
            <h3>Facts behind the need for change</h3>

            <p>This policy relies on a solid base of personal experience as an international student within UHI for the
                past two years.</p>

            <p>Throughout this period, I have come across several situations in which international student information
                was difficult to access, and staff could not point me in the right direction. This went from the
                application process, during which local staff omitted essential information about the translation of
                documents, to the day-to-day life, when sending queries to international@uhi.ac.uk.</p>

            <p>A few international students met throughout the academic journey spoke of similar experiences. The need
                for increased student support over such challenging times was made clear by the last NUS student survey.
                Although this focussed on the impact of the pandemic on students’ mental health, I believe it still goes
                to highlight how vulnerable the student body is, and how important it is for it to be properly
                supported.</p>

            <p>International students can be considered particularly vulnerable during times of profound social and
                political change, and as a student association, HISA should take a stand.</p>

    <h2>Chapliancy</h2>

                <h3>What needs to change</h3>

                <p>UHI and the academic partners have overlooked an important element of the student welfare ever since
                    UHI
                    was formed. UHI is the only university in Scotland which has no chaplaincy provision on offer to
                    support
                    the students.</p>

                <p>Chaplaincy service plays a crucial part in the infrastructure designed to support all students
                    regardless
                    of their background. This provision is for all students from Christians, Muslims, LGBTQ+, or any
                    other
                    belief or identity. Chaplaincy service protects students welfare, supports students in crisis, gives
                    advice on equality to the university, and facilitates students' needs at the university.</p>

                <p>Students are under immense pressure due to COVID restrictions and the impact of this period will
                    continue
                    to add significant pressure for our students. This is why we need a chaplaincy service to be
                    established
                    as soon as possible.</p>

                <p>HISA is the voice of students at UHI and as such is the only one that can lobby for a post creation
                    for a
                    chaplaincy service. This is why I ask the HISA CON to vote for a crucial new provision to be
                    provided
                    for the students at UHI.</p>

                <p>If successful the motion would require to be lead by the HISA President, with the support of key
                    student
                    officers from the HISA Executive. The reason for a high-level push would be required to get UHI to

            <p>During the December festive period, mid-term breaks, and easter break, students that are studying away
                from home in the wilderness of the Highlands are more exposed to feelings of loneliness, which might
                affect their mental health.</p>

                <p>We see huge differences in the student experience in especially further education courses across UHI
                    and
                    its academic partners, while the HE experience is more equal and less dependent on the geographical

                    of the student.</p>

                <p>While UHI's Higher education curriculum is linked up and quality monitored regionally, we currently
                    don't
                    see this in Further education courses. A regionally linked up further education curriculum would
                    enable
                    students to have equity in student experience, more good practice sharing in teaching methods and
                    there
                    would be less duplication of work.</p>
