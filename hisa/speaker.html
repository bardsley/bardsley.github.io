        <h2>Gavin Oattes</h2>

        <h3>Monday 25th January, 14.30- 15:30</h3>

        <p>“Inspirational”, “Mind-Blowing”, “Hilarious” and “Barn-Storming” are just a few of the words used by clients
            to describe Gavin Oattes and his unique ability to entertain, enlighten and educate an audience.</p>

        <p>Gavin is an international keynote speaker, award winning comedian, best-selling author of SHINE, LIFE WILL
            SEE YOU NOW and DIARY OF A BRILLIANT KID. Although he spends much of his time speaking to business leaders
            and directors of some of the world’s leading organisations Gavin’s true inspiration for what he does comes
            from where he started out his career…primary school teaching.</p>

        <p>He’s a firm believer that we as adults can be every bit as inspired by young children as they can by us
            grown-ups. Gavin transports his audience back to when they were just 5 years of age, a time when we feared
            nothing and embraced everything.</p>

        <p>Over the past decade, Gavin has worked with literally hundreds of thousands of people and is now regarded as
            one the most talented and sought after speakers in the UK.</p>

        <p>Gavin will be leading a inspiring talk, aimed at UHI students, particularly focusing on the past year and
            what we have learnt as a community- don’t miss your chance and sign up now!</p>

        <p>“Truth time: life’s a short and precious gift that’s hurtling by in a blur. There is a whole beige generation
            out there buried under the stifling pressures of adulthood. Gavin will deliver a wake-up call for you to
            search your soul, to shake things up and bask in the warmth of glorious individuality. Oh, and with a
            surname like ‘Oattes’, he’s definitely going to encourage us all to think about cereal in a way we’ve never
            done before…”</p>
