        <p>Scottish singer-songwriter Nicky Murray has been writing and recording music for around 8 years. 2014 saw his
            debut album 'Plenty More Weeping' released which helped to put him on the map to some degree. After several
            singles released in 2017, Nicky wrote his latest sophomore record 'Wintermore' in Autumn 2018, which
            features a stellar line-up of musicians accompanying him. Having toured with/supported (in several different
            outfits) a wide range of artists from Martin Stephenson, JJ Gilmour, Elephant Sessions, Kathryn Joseph,
            Peatbog Faeries, Dave Sharp, Brittany &amp; Natalie Haas, Duncan Chisholm, among more. Nicky also is the
            'City Leader' for Sofar Sounds (Inverness) organizing live music shows every month with many notable
            artists.</span></p>
        <p>2019 was spent playing lots of gigs, writing new music, several collaborations, including two Scottish tours
            with songwriter and friend Moteh Parrott. Nicky had many musical plans for 2020 but the pandemic curbed most
            of them, in adaption Nicky spent lockdown teaching and working on his own music, releasing two singles.
            First came 'Atypical' which was written about the Netflix show of the same name, and was championed by the
            main cast. Next came 'Song for Sara' a song written for the loss of a close friend. A third single came in
            early September with an across the pond collaboration with Louise Bichan (Rachel Sermanni) and Ethan
            Setiawan (Darol Anger) with their single 'Songbird'. It is likely that a couple more singles will be on
            their way over the summer, whilst in the meantime Nicky is working away carefully constructing his next
            record. Heis usually found accompanied with coherent gentle string players, and the occasional harmony
            singer. Nicky strives for expression and connection.</span></p>
