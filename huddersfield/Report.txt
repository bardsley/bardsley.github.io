Todo

move the getPageTitle to somewhere always loaded, like maybe

Page main script doesn't check for safety and fails. This means menu editing code at bottom never runs
A different script elsewhere edits the menu so the menu works
If the main script is repaired then this menu editing code will run twice, at best wasting energy and making debugging harder at worst (and currently) it will break the menu
If removed will menu still work https://www.huddersfield.su/administrator/sites/3521/pages/83158/edit
